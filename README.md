## 🏁 Project Overview
This project focuses on organizing and cleaning Olympic data files in preparation for analysis.  
In Milestone 1, our group focused on:
- Setting up the project repository  
- Understanding the dataset and identifying potential issues  
- Creating a working prototype that generates all required output files  

This milestone serves as a check-in to confirm that our group has started, divided tasks, and understands the problem requirements before deeper data processing in later stages.

## 🧠 Milestone 1 Deliverables
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `project.py` Prototype program that generates 5 new CSV files with correct headers 
| `tasks.md` Group 10 member roles and assigned tasks 
| `prompts.md` Record of learning resources consulted during development 
| `ms1_prob_id.md` Problem identification – documents unknown data, handling plan, and validation strategy 
| `new_olympic_athlete_bio.csv` Placeholder bio file (same as original structure) 
| `new_olympic_athlete_event_results.csv` Event results file with added “age” column 
| `new_olympics_country.csv`  Placeholder for country data 
| `new_olympics_games.csv`  Placeholder for games data 
| `new_medal_tally.csv` Output file with required header fields 

 How to Run the Prototype
1. Clone this repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/asuleiman10/olympics-data-project.git
   cd olympics-data-project


   ##Next Steps (Milestone 2)
Clean and normalize Paris dataset  
Handle missing and inconsistent values  
Merge athlete, country, and medal data into unified structures  
Implement calculations for medal tallies and summaries

This repository follows the guidelines outlined in the course instructions.  
All work was completed collaboratively by Group 10 using approved resources such as course videos, official documentation, and peer discussion.
